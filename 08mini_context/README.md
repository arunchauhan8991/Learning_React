# What we learn in this mini project:
# 1. How to use Context API in React to manage global state.
//  This is useful for passing data that needs to be accessed by many components at different levels of the component tree.

# 2. How to create a context and a provider component.
//  The provider component wraps the application and provides the context value to all child components.

# 3. How to consume context in functional components using useContext hook.
//  The useContext hook allows you to access the context value in any functional component without having to pass it down through props.

# 4. How to update context state from child components. 
//  You can use the context value to update the state from any child component that consumes the context.
//  This is useful for managing user authentication state, theme settings, or any other global state that needs to be shared across components.
